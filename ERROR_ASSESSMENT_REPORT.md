## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES - IN PROGRESS

### 2. TypeScript `any` Usage - SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

**✅ Files Fixed (Eliminated ALL any types):**
- `src/utils/api/ApiIntegrationTypes.ts` - **20+ any types → Proper interfaces**
- `src/utils/bulkOperations/types.ts` - **3 any types → Generic types**  
- `src/utils/bulkOperations/BulkProgressTracker.ts` - **3 any types → Generic types**

**🔧 Remaining High-Impact Files:**
- `src/utils/verification/*` - 300+ errors (largest impact area)
- `src/utils/api/*` - 180+ errors  
- `src/utils/assessment/*` - 100+ errors
- `supabase/functions/*` - 50+ errors

**Impact of fixes so far:**
- ✅ Improved type safety in API integrations
- ✅ Better IntelliSense support in fixed areas
- ✅ Eliminated 25+ any types across key files

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities ✅ IMPROVED

**Status:** 3 MODERATE VULNERABILITIES (reduced from 5)

```bash
# Remaining vulnerabilities (dev tools only):
- esbuild <=0.24.2 (No fix available)
- vite 0.11.0 - 6.1.6 (Depends on vulnerable esbuild)  
- lovable-tagger (Depends on vulnerable vite)
```

✅ **Fixed:**
- Updated all possible dependencies
- Removed deprecated @supabase/auth-helpers-react

### 4. Deprecated Dependencies ✅ RESOLVED

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

✅ **Migrated:** @supabase/auth-helpers-react removed (was unused)

## 🔧 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES ✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED  

### 5. Code Quality Issues - SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

✅ **Fixed:**
- **17 case declaration errors** in TableUtilizationAssessor.ts
- **2 prefer-const warnings** (SingleSourceValidator.ts, MockDataDetector.ts)
- **1 require() import** in tailwind.config.ts

🔧 **Remaining:**
- Additional case declaration errors in other files
- @ts-ignore usage (should use @ts-expect-error)
