## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Issue: Missing Dependencies**
The core problem was **missing npm dependencies** in the local environment:

1. **Symptom:** `vite: command not found` 
2. **Cause:** Node modules were not installed locally
3. **Impact:** Development server couldn't start, causing all page loading failures

### **Secondary Issue: Port Configuration Confusion**
- Application configured to run on **port 8080** (not default 5173)
- Configuration in `vite.config.ts`: `port: 8080`
