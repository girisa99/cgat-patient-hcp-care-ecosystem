# Unified Development Lifecycle System Documentation

## üéØ Overview

The Unified Development Lifecycle System consolidates ALL existing verification, validation, registry, update, learning, authentication, and role-based navigation systems into ONE comprehensive orchestrator that covers the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from market analysis to deployment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Principle Guidelines

1. **Single Source of Truth** - One central orchestrator, one central hook, one central registry
2. **Role-Based Progressive Disclosure** - Each role sees only relevant phases and operations
3. **Zero Duplication Policy** - Detect before create, consolidate before build, validate before deploy
4. **Sequential Dependency Chain** - Enforced workflow progression with validation gates
5. **Isolation & Reusability** - Template-driven components with complete isolation
6. **Automated Synchronization** - Real-time registry updates and cross-validation
7. **Continuous Verification** - Background monitoring with preventive blocking and self-healing

### Hybrid Orchestration Approach

    isInitialized,
    systemHealth,
    isAuthenticated,
    userRole,
    actions,
    currentWorkflow
  } = useUnifiedDevelopmentLifecycle();

  if (!isInitialized) {
    return <div>Initializing unified system...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>System Health: {systemHealth}%</h1>
      <p>Role: {userRole}</p>
      {currentWorkflow && (
        <p>Current Phase: {currentWorkflow.currentPhase}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Creating a New Project

```typescript
const createNewProject = async () => {
  try {
    const workflow = await actions.createProject('my-new-project', {
      marketAnalysis: {
        painPoints: ['User authentication complexity', 'Data management'],
        requirements: ['Simple login', 'Role-based access']
      }
    });
    
    console.log('Project created with', workflow.phases.length, 'phases');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Project creation failed:', error);
  }
};
```

### Progressing Through Phases

```typescript
const completeCurrentPhase = async () => {
  const artifacts = {
    market_research_doc: 'Completed market analysis document',
    competitor_analysis: 'Competitive landscape report',
    user_needs_analysis: 'User requirements document'
  };
  
  const success = await actions.progressPhase('market_analysis', artifacts);
  
  if (success) {
    console.log('Phase completed successfully!');
  }
};
```

### Role-Based Operation Validation

```typescript
const attemptOperation = (operation: string) => {
  if (actions.validateOperation(operation)) {
    // User has permission for this operation
    performOperation(operation);
  } else {
    console.log(`Access denied for operation: ${operation}`);
  }
};
```

### Learning Capture

```typescript
const handleUserError = (context: string, error: string) => {
  const learningId = actions.captureLearning(
    context,
    error,
    { userFeedback: 'This was confusing', timestamp: Date.now() }
  );
  
  console.log('Learning captured:', learningId);
};

- All monitoring is continuous
- All learning is immediate

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### System Not Initializing
- Verify authentication is working
- Check user roles are loaded
- Ensure database connectivity

#### Phase Progression Blocked
- Verify user has required role for phase

- Verify learning data is being captured
- Ensure insights are being generated

### Debug Commands

```typescript
// Get comprehensive system report
const report = actions.getSystemReport();
console.log('System Report:', report);

// Check available operations for current user
const operations = actions.getAvailableOperations();
console.log('Available Operations:', operations);

// Run system health check
await actions.runSystemCheck();
```
